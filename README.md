# news_feed
This parses through several WSJ RSS feeds and creates an audio file out of the article summaries. 

You can easily add or remove feeds as you desire and play around with the gTTS configuration. 

You can also change how often it pulls and updates the mp3 file so that you can have up to date news as you desire.

As it is written now, the file is pushed onto my iCloud folder so I can access it from my phone.
